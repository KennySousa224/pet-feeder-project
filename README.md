# Automated Pet Feeder System

The aim of thi project is to design a low-cost, automated pet feeder for a local animal shelter. The goal is to create a system that can dispense food for cats and dogs at scheduled times, monitor consumption, and alert staff to any issues.
Key Features and Constraints are

## The design is intentionally limited to low-cost components that can withstand potential animal damage.
1.	The same food is provided for cats and dogs, but the animals are kept separately. 
2.	Animals have free access to the machine throughout the day.
3.	The user will also be able to set the schedule time and also adjust the real time clock if needed.  
4.	The system will be able to alert the user if the food bin is empty and if there was no food consumption in the following minutes after the bowl was fulfilled. 
5.	The bowl portion mass, is based on the number of seconds the servo feeder motor is on. Thus, the system can be used to feed one or more animals at time.

## The prject is divided into 5 folders named as followed:

Step 1_Understand and Define the Problem (Analyse)
Step 2_Organise and Describe the Data
Step 3_Plan the Solution (Design the Algorithm)
Step 4_Implement the Solution (Word Coding)
Step 5_Test and Refine the Solution (Debug and Verify)
The main folder also contains a Short Reflection on Copilot World file.
